# mern-stack
Another boilerplate code for getting started with MERN stack using Webpack

## Introduction
This is an example generic code to help you (and me) to get started with the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) stack. It will include other useful technologies that will list below:

* M ongoDB
* E xpressJS
* R eactJS
* N odeJS

On this step you should be able to run the project typing:
```
  git clone https://github.com/ateixeira/mern-stack.git
  git checkout tags/3-Handlebars-ReactJS
  cd mern-stack
  npm install
```
## Build the app
